The project utilizes several key React concepts, including:

1. **React Router**: For implementing navigation and routing across the application.
2. **Props and State**: To manage and pass data between components dynamically.
3. **Conditional Rendering**: For changing UI based on dynamic conditions (e.g., homepage background).
4. **Reusable Components**: Built modular, reusable components like `NavBar`, `Footer`, and `GadgetDetail`.
5. **Custom Hooks**: To streamline functionality like detecting the current route using `useLocation()`.
